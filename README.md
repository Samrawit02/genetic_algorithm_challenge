Genetic Algorithm using Python

#### A basic optimization problem   
A van in a shop must be filled to transport household appliances, its load must be optimized by maximizing the value of what is transported for a given volume. You have a file with occupied space, price and quantity of certain products (file at https://github.com/Ishikawa7/Quick-paths-to-start/tree/main/Genetic%20algorithms/Step%204). Test for variable free space values, for example between 1 and 5.
